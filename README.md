# Reproducible workflows

Functions that (try to) improve the reproducibility of scripted workflows.

Run these functions in the template or master folder before each MODFLOW and PEST++ run (for example in the *prep_deps()* function, at the end of the *pst_setup()* function, the beginning of the *deploy_pestpp()* function)

- Feel free to improve existing functions and add new functions!
- Try to make the functions work across multiple platforms
